# USB-Malware
This is a small malware written in python. I don't recommend you to use it

This program detects when a USB flash drive is connected to your computer (yours or not ;)). Then all files are copied and pasted in a local folder called "USB" created in your current working directory.

Don't do that if you love your friends.
